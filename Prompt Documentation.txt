AI-Generated & Manipulated Media Detection Platform
Project Overview

This project focuses on building a web-based platform to detect AI-generated and manipulated images, videos, and audio using a modular, secure, and scalable architecture. The system emphasizes probabilistic risk assessment, transparency, and real-time usability for digital platforms.

Technology Stack

Frontend: React + Vite (Apple-inspired UI)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Authentication: Token-based API access

Database: MySQL with Prisma ORM

Deployment: Cloud-hosted frontend and backend services

Task-Based Prompt Documentation
Task 1: Frontend Development (React + Vite, Apple-Style UI)
Prompt

Build a premium, Apple-inspired frontend UI for a web platform that detects AI-generated and manipulated images, videos, and audio.

Use React + Vite for frontend development only.

Design a clean, minimal interface with white space, soft shadows, rounded corners, and modern typography.

Implement the following pages:

Landing page with a clear problem statement and a single “Analyze Media” call-to-action

Upload page supporting images, short videos, and audio files with drag-and-drop functionality

Analysis state with a subtle loading animation and reassurance about data privacy

Results page showing AI-likelihood percentage, confidence level, and a short explanation

Focus entirely on UI/UX clarity, responsiveness, and demo-readiness. No backend logic or authentication handling.

Task 2: Media Upload & API Integration Layer
Prompt

Create a stable frontend-to-backend integration layer for uploading and analyzing images, videos, and audio files.

Automatically detect media type after upload and validate file size, format, and duration before sending requests.

Communicate with a Node.js + Express backend using a single analysis endpoint.

Handle asynchronous requests, show upload and analysis progress, prevent duplicate submissions, and display clear error messages.

Ensure no page reloads, no UI blocking, and graceful handling of network or backend failures.

Focus on reliability and predictable demo behavior rather than feature expansion.

Task 3: Backend Detection Pipeline with Authentication (Node.js + Express)
Prompt

Design a secure backend detection pipeline that authenticates requests and analyzes images, videos, and audio to assess AI-generated or manipulated content.

Implement token-based authentication to protect analysis endpoints. Only authenticated requests should be processed.

Automatically identify media type and route each file to its respective detection pipeline:

Images: visual artifacts, texture repetition, lighting inconsistencies

Videos: frame-to-frame inconsistencies, facial stability, temporal anomalies

Audio: spectral patterns, acoustic smoothness, timing irregularities

Generate probabilistic outputs including AI-likelihood percentage, confidence level, and plain-English explanations.

Ensure fast, non-blocking processing and graceful handling of invalid files or authentication failures.

Task 4: Database, Logging & Audit Layer (MySQL + Prisma ORM)
Prompt

Design a privacy-aware persistence layer using MySQL with Prisma ORM to store analysis metadata and system logs.

Store only essential information:

Request ID

Auth token or user reference (non-sensitive)

Media type and file metadata

AI-likelihood score and confidence level

Detection summary

Timestamps

Log successful and failed analysis attempts, authentication failures, and backend errors.

Do not store raw media files or personal user data.

Use Prisma for schema management, consistency, and future migrations.

Focus on traceability, reliability, and compliance-friendly design.

Task 5: Deployment, Testing & Demo Readiness
Prompt

Deploy the complete system (frontend, backend, database) as publicly accessible services suitable for hackathon demonstration.

Ensure secure configuration using environment variables and stable frontend–backend communication.

Test the full workflow: upload → analysis → result for images, videos, and audio.

Validate error handling, authentication failures, and invalid inputs.

Optimize for fast response times and predictable behavior under demo conditions.

Prepare a repeatable demo flow with pre-tested media and fallback messaging for failures.
